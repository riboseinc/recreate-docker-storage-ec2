= recreate-docker-storage-ec2.sh


== Description

This script is meant for AWS EC2 instances (RHEL7 and CentOS7) to wipe out any
existing Docker storage and recreate the necessary PVs, VG, and LV through
devicemapper to use ephemeral and EBS storage. It then formats the resulting LV
for ext4, and makes Docker use the LV. It can be run any number of times without
negative effects.

You need to run all this ephemeral setup stuff on every boot, not only on first
boot of an ECS instance. User-data provided scripts are only executes on the
first boot, install this script as a service which starts before Docker.

The flow of this script is as follows:

1. Disable Docker
2. Stop Docker
3. Unmount the Docker mount point
4. Unmount ephemeral drives
5. Sanitise block devices
6. Remove logical volumes (`dmsetup remove`, `vgremove`, `lvremove` and `pvremove`)
7. Prepare and (optionally) mount (`vgcreate`, `lvcreate`, `mkfs`, and `mount`)

There are several sleeps during each step because sometimes on slower EC2
instances it takes a couple of seconds for changes to become active and visible.


== Usage

This will recreate the storage and not mount:
```sh
sudo ./recreate-docker-storage-ec2.sh
```

This will recreate the storage and mount:
```sh
sudo ./recreate-docker-storage-ec2.sh mount
```

Passing the `mount` argument will result in a mount of the created partition to `/var/lib/docker`.
